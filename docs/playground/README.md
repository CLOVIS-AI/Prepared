# OpenSavvy Playground

The Playground is a collection of repositories which act as both demonstrators of what we consider "good practice", and as templates to bootstrap projects.
Unlike other template projects, the Playground is meant to be updated continuously so each project which started using it profits from its updates.
This way, we can ensure our projects follow a familiar structure.

You're reading this document either because you're reading one of the projects of the Playground, or because you're reading one of the projects which is based on the Playground.

We encourage keeping this documentation as part of projects using the Playground, so it is always available to understand how the project is structured. We do not recommend editing it in projects; instead, contribute to the Playground directly, so all projects get updated.

Each Playground adds its own page to the following list:
- [Baseline](baseline.md)
