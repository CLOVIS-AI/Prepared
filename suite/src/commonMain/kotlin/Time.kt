/**
 * Time control center.
 *
 * ## Why?
 *
 * Often, we need to create algorithms that behave differently when executed at different times.
 * Using the system clock makes code much harder to test, or problems to reproduce.
 * Instead, it is recommended that algorithms take as input a "time generator", so fake implementations can be injected for testing.
 * - When we want to measure elapsed time, we should inject a [TimeSource] (see [Time.source]).
 * - When we want to access the current time, we should inject some kind of Clock (e.g. the one provided by `java.time`, or the one provided by `KotlinX.Datetime`, see the various extensions on [Time]).
 *
 * When executing the system under test, we need to provide such objects to the algorithm.
 * This attribute, [time], is the control center for generating such values and for controlling their outputs.
 *
 * ## Delay-skipping
 *
 * Inside tests, calls to [delay] are skipped in a way that keeps the order of events.
 * This makes tests much faster to execute without compromising on testing algorithms that need to wait for an event.
 *
 * This also applies to other time-related coroutine control functions, like [withTimeout].
 *
 * This allows to trivially implement algorithms which require skipping a large amount of time:
 * ```kotlin
 * test("Data is expired after 6 months") {
 *     val data = createSomeData()
 *     assertFalse(data.isExpired())
 *
 *     delay((6 * 30).days)
 *
 *     assertTrue(data.isExpired())
 * }
 * ```
 * Assuming all services use either the test clock or the test time source, the entire system will think 6 months have passed,
 * and all started tasks will have run the same number of times, and in the same order, as if 6 months had actually passed.
 *
 * To learn more about delay skipping, see the KotlinX.Coroutines' documentation: [runTest].
 *
 * > The delay-skipping behavior is controlled by [Time.scheduler].
 * > If you want to create your own coroutines, remember to add the scheduler to their [CoroutineContext], or they will delay for real.
 *
 * ## Time control
 *
 * Inside tests, a virtual time is available, that describes how much delay has been skipped.
 * A test always starts at the epoch.
 * [delay] allows us to move time forwards, executing all tasks as their execution date is reached.
 * We can also control the time directly.
 *
 * - [Time.nowMillis]: Access the current time in milliseconds (see the various `now*` accessors).
 * - [Time.advanceByMillis], [Time.advanceBy]: Advance the current time without executing the awaiting tasks.
 * - [Time.advanceUntilIdle]: Advance the current time, executing all tasks in order, until all tasks have been executed.
 * - [Time.runCurrent]: Run all tasks enqueued for the current time.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * This example checks that an event was recorded at the expected time:
 * ```kotlin
 * test("The event should be recorded at the current time") {
 *     val start = time.nowMillis
 *     val result = foo()
 *     val end = time.nowMillis
 *
 *     assert(result.timestamp > start)
 *     assert(result.timestamp < end)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see Time.source Measure elapsed time
 * @see Time.nowMillis Current time, in milliseconds
