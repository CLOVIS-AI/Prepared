# OpenSavvy Prepared

> This project is experimental.

Testing libraries are composed of three different components:
- The **assertions** check that values are what we expect,
- The **structure** is the way tests are declared and discovered,
- The **runner** is the program that executes the tests.

OpenSavvy Prepared is a **structure** library: it concentrates on the way tests are declared.
It is possible to use other libraries (e.g. [Kotlin Test](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/), [Kotest](https://kotest.io/), [Strikt](https://strikt.io/)â€¦) to declare assertions.
